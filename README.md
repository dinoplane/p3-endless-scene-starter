Artist Statement
I am trying to show the user the beauty of bacteria. To acheive this effect, I made sure all same colored tiles connected to each other only. I also rounded every corner
on the cells and added tubes connecting different cell types. I could improve on this by making the cells more circular and more curves.

I also added some staining to give the user more control over what they are seeing.
